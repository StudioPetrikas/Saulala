## Known issues:
Known (big) bugs:

- You need to explicitly allow storage access permissions on Android (Settings -> Apps (Applications) -> Select "Saulala" -> Allow Storage (& Music))
- App becomes unresponsive after switching tasks
- Main viewport becomes black after loading a new image, move a slider to refresh it

I recommend installing a logcat reader of sorts. Error reporting is still sparse, but I've got a bunch of print commands that should help when trying to swat bugs. 
I use "Logcat Reader Pro". Filter by "Python".
